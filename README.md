Airbnb acts as a platform for hosts and travelers. Hosts can put up their property for stay, and if someone wishes to stay there, the hosts get rent in exchange. The individuals who stay at Airbnb get a completely different experience by staying close to the locals.
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales. Airbnb offers people an easy, relatively stress-free way to earn some income from their property.
